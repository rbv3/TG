## How to control the deformations
On the top right corner of your screen you'll see a small menu with some options:
- Opacity: controls the opacity of the invisible materials
- Invisibility Radius: the radius (centered on the camera) in which all materials inside of the circle will be invisile
- Diameter: diameter of cilinder on distorions
- Rama: toggle on/off regular UrbanRama distortion
- Distance Rama: toggle on/off UrbanRama distortion in a distance from the camera (the distance is the invisibility radius)
- X Rama: toggle on/off Rama distortion on the sides (X-Axis)
